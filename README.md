# Linear Search

## Description
This program demonstrates the **Linear Search algorithm** in C++. The user inputs the array size, array elements, and a target element. The program checks each element of the array sequentially to find the target. If the element is found, its position is displayed; otherwise, it informs the user that the element is not present.

## Key Points
- Works for both sorted and unsorted arrays.
- Checks each element one by one until the target is found.
- Uses a boolean flag to track whether the element is found.
