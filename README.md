# Linear Search in C++

## Description
This is a simple C++ program that demonstrates the **Linear Search algorithm**. 
The program allows the user to input the size of an array, the array elements, 
and a value to search. It checks each element sequentially and outputs the 
position if the element is found or a message if it is not present.

## How to Use
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `LinearSearch.cpp` in any C++ IDE (Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, VS Code, etc.).
3. Compile and run the program.
4. Enter the number of elements, array values, and the element to search.
5. The program will display the position of the element if found, otherwise it will say "Element not found".
